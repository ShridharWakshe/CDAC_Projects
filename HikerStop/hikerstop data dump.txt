Description :
The Katraj to Sinhagad trek is one of the toughest and closest treks to the city of Pune. Popularly known as K2S, this trek is one of my personal favourites. It can be done as a Monsoon Trek and even as a Night Trek. It is very popular as a Full Moon Night Trek as well. Over the last 9 years, I have had the chance to lead this treks at least twice a year, with people from all walks of life, the youngest being 8 years. If you have a weekend free, the Katraj to Sinhagad trek (K2S) provides a perfect alternative from the drinking and bar hopping, giving you a unique glimpse of the city skyline, lite up under the night sky.
Day Wise Schedule :
This is a long climb taking almost an hour depending on your speed. The trail can be confusing at times, but the key is to aim for the top of the Hill. The trail crosses above the New Katraj Tunnel, and you can see cars and trucks below you on the highway. After a long and at times, hard climb, you will reach the top of the hill, to be greeted by spectacular views of the city. The cool breeze at the top of the ridge is refreshing, helping to soothe away the fatigue of the climb. This is a good place to rest and drink water, before setting off on the next hill.

With the hilly terrain of the Sahyadri range and the able expertise of the Maratha King Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj at establishing forts at strategic points, Maharashtra has over 350 odd Forts which are some of the finest, strongest, and the most unique Forts of India. Out of these, the ones at Lohagad and Visapur occupy an extremely important place in the history for the various military activities they witnessed. These forts were important for anyone who ruled the region because they were used to guard the trade route going through the Bor Ghat, now called as Khandala Ghat. These two forts are connected by a ‘col’ (sharp-edged ridge) known as ‘gaymukh’. Visapur Fort is known for its unbroken line of fortification, which remains in a reasonably good condition even today. This fort was built by Balaji Vishwanath, the first Peshwa of the Maratha Empire, during 1713-1720. Within the fort are caves, cisterns of water, a decorated arch and old houses.

Description :
Darjeeling, internationally acclaimed as one of the best hill resorts in India is also a veritable paradise for trekkers and adventure seekers. Trekking in Darjeeling is an experience which no lover of nature should miss. It takes one to places where nature is yet in her primeval majesty. It brings one face to face with the sublime grandeur of the Himalayas. The region abounds in rhododendrons, magnolias, primulas, orchids and ferns of numerous varieties. About six hundred different species of birds inhabit the emerald green forests on the slopes of the mountains. This trek is perhaps one of the best and certainly the most popular of all the treks in Darjeeling for those having a limited time at their disposal. It offers the travelers an excellent view of the Sleeping Buddha, Kanchenjunga and the Everest group of mountain peaks in Nepal, Sikkim and Bhutan.
Day Wise Schedule :

Flight connections are available from Delhi and Kolkata, but please make sure that your flight reaches NJP in such a way that you can proceed to Manebhanjang by 11am. Yuvashakti will arrange for the airport pick up and you reach Manebhanjang by 4pm. Overnight at Manebhanjang. Day 2 Manebhanjang to Tumling. (11kms. / 5 hrs.). The trek begins with a good, fairly steep climb of about two hours upto Chitrey. Then onwards the trail becomes relatively easy with a few ups and downs till you reach Tumling which lies right on the Indo Nepal border. A step to the left and you are in Nepal and in another second you can switch back into India. Overnight at a tea house at Tumling Day 3 Tumling to Kalpokhari (14kms. / 7hrs.) The morning, if clear, greets you with enchanting views of the Sleeping Buddha, though at a distance. The day passes through hills and valleys of the Singalila National Park. A motorable road keep criss crossing the trail and plies tourists to Sandakphu. We prefer to keep away from the road and walk uphill through beautiful Rhododendron forests until we reach Gairibas, which is a small village in Nepal and having a forest check post. The army too has a permanent camp here. The trek from hereon is a fair climb of four kilometers through scenic patches of green that attract a large variety of birds. The walk ends at a tea house at Kalpokhari. Day 4 Kalipokhri to Sandakphu (6kms. / 4 hrs.) The trek to Sandakphu starts with a gradual ascent of about 45 minutes which them becomes steeper. But you are equally rewarded with the sights of the deep valleys on one side and the dwindling trail to Sandakphu on the other. An hours walk and you reach a point which unfolds a 180 degree panorama, one which presents before you four of the worlds five tallest peaks - Makalu, Lhotse, Everest, Nuptse, Baruntse, Chamling, Chomolonzo, Machapucchare, and the other dotting peaks of Nepal. The Sleeping Buddha, which you witnessed off and on from a distance, now lies distinctly in front of you - The Kanchenjunga, Kumbhakarna and Shimbho peaks, all make the unique shape of the Sleeping Buddha. So grand is the view that you will refrain from getting inside the tea house until it is complete dark. Day 5 Sandakphu to Sirikhola (15kms. / 7hrs.) The last day of this trek begins with a memorable sunrise that will keep returning to your mind for a hundred times after you reach home. Witnessing the majesty of the golden peaks that tower over a set of lazy clouds is something worth a visit to Sandakphu. The longest stretch of the trek is a relatively steep descend through such a bushy and green landscape, that it has become a habitat of the Red Pandas. We conclude the long march at Sirikhola which also is the end of the trek. Day 6 Sirikhola to NJP. A short trek of 1 km upto Sepi, where we board the vehicles and leave for NJP. We collect the leftover baggage at Manebhanjan and reach Darjeeling by 2 pm. Stroll on the mall road and spend a memorable evening admiring the last glimpses of Kanchenjunga. Overnight at Darjeeling.
